                <h3>Functionalities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students will be able to have an insight into their grades from CampusNet in addition to assignments and submissions grades (from Moodle) directly and from the same place, a count will allow students to keep track of their evolution and their overall grades</li>
                    <li>Students can check for kitchen or laundry room availability and planning accordingly. Same goal will be achieved by the public transportation schedules, that they can check in the same place (instead of using a new google search or using DB app).</li>
                    <li>The “call” functionality will allow student, by the help of other students, to complete what they would usually miss. The nature of the “call” may be anything. Aspects where this may be helpful are illimited.</li>
